## Introduction

This plugin allows you to utilize cookie key-value pairs, concatenated as a string, within a template variable. I encountered a specific use case that required this functionality, prompting me to publish it as a plugin.

To use the plugin, simply specify the keys that need inclusion, separated by commas (,), and choose a separator character to be used.
